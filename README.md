# Dynamic-Programming-Car-Rental
Simple reinforcement learning problem solved with dynamic programming.

The problem is taken from the book 'Reinforcement Learning' by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto and is as follows:
''Jack manages two branches of a car rental company. Each day a Poisson-distributed number of customers come to each location and for each car rented out, Jack earns $10. Any car rented is returned at the end of the day but must spend the next day being serviced (not available for renting). Both rentable and serviced cars take up space and each branch has an upper limit to the cars that can be stored. Jack is able to transfer cars between the branches at the cost of $2 per car overnight. Only cars not being serviced can be transferred and transferred cars are available for rent at the new branch the next day.

What is the optimal transfer policy of cars between branches?''
